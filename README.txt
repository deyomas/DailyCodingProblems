This repo contains any attempts at solving code problems from DailyCodingProblem.com
Solutions are sorted by language and in each language the solutions are divided by days

There is a template folder which mimics the layout of any solution. It will contain:
  -A text file describing the problem as given
  -A batch file to assist with compiling. This is used for development and shouldn't be needed to test code
  -A program to run with the main class name being the same as the date name. (October 12 would be in 10-12, program is 10-12.cs or other)
  -Any supporting files or further classes needed. (I'll need to figure out how to compile multiple class files in each language. Header files would be nice)

In each solution file there will be a compiled executable to run. This should ideally be runnable in Windows command prompt
